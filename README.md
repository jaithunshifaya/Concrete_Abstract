## Features ✨
- Abstract and Concrete Classes: Demonstrates the use of Java abstraction and concrete class implementations.
- Encapsulation & Inheritance: Applies core OOP principles to structure the course system.
- Multiple Course Types: Supports both Classroom Courses and Online Courses.
- User Input Handling: Uses Scanner for interactive user selection of courses.
- Switch Case Implementation: Efficiently selects courses using a structured decision-making process.
