Concrete and Abstract
A Java Project Demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming

📌 Project Overview
This project, Concrete and Abstract, is designed to demonstrate the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. It includes the implementation of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction through a course management system.

🔹 Key Features
✅ Implements Abstract and Concrete Classes
✅ Demonstrates Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
✅ Manages different types of Courses (Online & Classroom)
✅ Uses User Input to select courses dynamically
✅ Implements Switch Statements for Course Selection

🛠 Technologies Used
Java (Object-Oriented Programming)

VS Code (Development Environment)

Git & GitHub (Version Control)
